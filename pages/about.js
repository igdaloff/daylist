      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p><a href="//igdaloff.com">Nathan Igdaloff</a> built this little web app in 2022 to learn NextJS, and to encourage him to both better organize his days and to journal. It was inspired by a similar app by <a href="https://nathandorney.com/">Nathan Dorney</a>.</p>
      <p>The code is available to view on <a href="https://github.com/igdaloff/daylist">Github</a>.</p>
